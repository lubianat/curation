## Abstract {.page_break_before}

To conduct a systematic review, researches spend hours of work on extracting data from and about the individual papers that are screened for the synthesis. This step often leads to the production of spreadsheets of structured data and metadata about scientific publications, which are the basis for later steps in the project. These datasets will often remain unavailable, hidden in some local folder, despite the time invested to produce them and the potential value it has for the scientific community. We argue that, with a little planning, making these intermediate datasets available to the public is a simple but valuable step for the scientific community, which also allows the recognition of the work done.
